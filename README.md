# Get Next Line

## Objective

Create a function that reads and return a line at time from a file descriptor.

## Bonus

Use only one static variable and be able to read from multiple file descriptors at the same time.

## Code style

This project should respect some code style rules:

A max of five functions per file and a max of 25 lines per function. 

The loops should be implemented using while.

Global variables aren't allowed.
